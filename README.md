There are two databases in this project: one for real-looking dev data, and another for simpler test data.You will need to create two .env files for your project: .env.test and .env.development. Into each, add PGDATABASE=, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names).
To complete the setup of the project run the following commands:
npm install
npm run setup-dbs // to create the dbs
npm run seed // to seed the databases
